# Solution: Pixel-Engine Fun

This solution contains various projects working with the [ninjapretzel Pixel-Engine](https://github.com/DevChrome/Pixel-Engine), which is itself a C# port of [OneLoneCoder's Pixel Game Engine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).

This repository is just me learning the engine and working to convert examples over to C# as I learn. It's not meant as a anything more than that.

## Project: PopUpMenuSystem

This project is my port of [OneLoneCoder's Retro Pop-Up Menu System](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine/blob/master/Videos/OneLoneCoder_PGE_RetroMenu.cpp). This is a direct port of his C++ Retro Pop-Up Menu System as I work alongside his [YouTube video on the subject](https://youtu.be/jde1Jq5dF0E), converting it over to C# as I go.
